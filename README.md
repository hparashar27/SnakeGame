The Snake Game 🐍🎮 is a classic and addictive web-based game that brings back the nostalgia of the old Nokia mobile phones. This project is implemented using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a perfect choice for beginners to learn and practice web development.

In this game, you control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with the game boundaries and its own tail. The game becomes progressively challenging as the snake grows longer and faster.


## Features

- **Simple and intuitive controls:** Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) to move the snake.
- **Score tracking:** Keep track of your score as you consume food items.
- **Game over screen:** When the snake collides with the game boundaries or itself, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.
- **Responsive design:** Play the game on both desktop and mobile devices with a responsive layout.
- **Speed increment:** The snake's speed increases as it grows longer, adding an extra layer of difficulty.
